KIEV, Ukraine (AP)  Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko says the establishment of an Orthodox Church independent of the Russian church is a major step toward moving out of Russia's shadow. On Christmas Day, which Ukrainian Orthodox believers celebrated on Monday, Poroshenko attended services in the capital's Sophia Cathedral. The service came a day after the leader of the world's Orthodox, Ecumenical Partriarch Bartholomew I, presented a decree recognizing the independent Orthodox Church of Ukraine. Previously, the Ukrainian church that was tied to the Moscow Patriarchate was considered canonical, or legitimate. "This is the foundation of our spiritual freedom. We have torn off the last chains that tied us to Moscow with its fantasies of Ukraine as a canonical territory of the Russian Orthodox Church, " Poroshenko said.
At least 30 people have been killed in the collapse of a gold mine in north-eastern Afghanistan, officials say. The collapse occurred in the Kohistan district of Badakhshan province. Villagers had reportedly dug a 60m (220ft) deep but makeshift shaft in a river bed to hunt for gold and were caught in its collapse. Afghanistan has vast resources of minerals but many of the mines are old and poorly maintained, creating severe safety issues. Villagers were reportedly using an excavator at the site when the mine collapsed. At least seven other people were injured, officials say. Kohistan district chief Rostam Raghi told the BBC's Afghan service: "Locals rushed to the scene and managed to rescue only 13 workers. Dozens of others, including some children, died. " Nik Mohammad Nazari, spokesman for the provincial governor, told Agence France-Presse: "The villagers have been involved in this business for decades with no government control over them. "We have sent a rescue team to the area, but villagers have already started removing bodies from the site. " A spokesman for the National Disaster Management Authority told AFP the families of the dead would receive 50, 000 afghanis ($660; 520). Afghanistan's vast resources remain largely untapped due to the conflict with the Taliban. The conflict has seen the rise in illegal mining both by villagers and Taliban fighters who use it as a key source of revenue.
MANILA, Jan 6  The death toll from a storm that devastated the Philippines shortly after Christmas rose to 126, authorities said today, adding landslides caused by torrential rain were the top cause. The storm hit central and eastern Philippine islands on December 29 and caused massive flooding and landslides. More than 100 people died in the mountainous Bicol region southeast of Manila, regional disaster officials said. While the Bicol region is often hit by deadly typhoons, many people failed to take necessary precautions because the storm was not strong enough to be rated as a typhoon under the governments storm alert system, according to civil defence officials. Officials also said that many residents were reluctant to leave their homes during the Christmas holidays. In two days alone, Usman poured more than a months worth of rainfall in the Bicol region,  national disaster agency spokesman Edgar Posadas told AFP, using the local name for the storm which had weakened into a low pressure area. Our search and retrieval operations are ongoing but the sticky mud and the unstable soil are a challenge. The death toll was likely to climb further with 26 people still missing, Posadas added. More than 152, 000 people were displaced by the storm and 75 were injured, according to the national disaster agency. President Rodrigo Duterte visited the storm-hit areas on Friday and urged officials to build evacuation centres instead of using schools as shelters for the displaced. About 20 typhoons and storms batter the Philippines each year, killing hundreds of people. The deadliest in recent years was Super Typhoon Haiyan which left more than 7, 360 people dead or missing across the central Philippines in 2013. AFP
Malaysias king has abdicated, royal officials said on Sunday, in a historic first for the country that ended weeks of speculation about his future after he took medical leave. Sultan Muhammed Vs decision marks the first time a king has abdicated in the Muslim-majority country since it gained independence from Britain in 1957. It came after the king took leave at the start of November for two months, during which time unconfirmed reports circulated that he had married a Russian former beauty queen. A statement from the national palace confirmed the resignation of the relatively youthful monarch, known for his fondness for four-wheel driving and other extreme sports. "His majesty tells the people of Malaysia to continue to be united to maintain unity, tolerance, and work together, " said the statement, signed by the Comptroller of the Royal Household, Wan Ahmad Dahlan Abdul Aziz. It gave no reason for the 49-year-olds move. But there had been a question mark over the reign of the king, who ascended to the throne in December 2016, since he took a leave of absence for medical treatment in November. Reports then circulated online that he had married a former Miss Moscow in Russia. Royal officials in Malaysia have so far not commented on the rumoured marriage, or given any details about his health condition. While their role is ceremonial, Malaysias Islamic royalty command great respect, especially from Muslim Malays, and criticising them is strictly forbidden. Speculation intensified about the kings future this week when the countrys Islamic royals reportedly held a special meeting. Malaysia is a constitutional monarchy, with a unique arrangement where the throne changes hands every five years between rulers of the nine Malaysian states headed by centuries-old Islamic royalty. The rotating monarchy system has been in place since independence from Britain in 1957, and Sultan Muhammed V is the first monarch to have renounced the throne. Sultan Muhammed V studied at St Cross College at Oxford and the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies, according to official media. He is known for a relaxed public persona, taking part in walkathons to promote health, and has been photographed wearing a baseball cap backwards. Portraits of the king and queen adorn government buildings throughout the country. The king is also the symbolic head of Islam in the nation, as well as the nominal chief of the military. Malaysias sultans trace a lineage back to Malay sultanates of the 15th century. The king is referred to as Yang di-Pertuan Agong, or "He Who Is Made Lord".
PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - The Taliban will not attend planned peace talks with the United States in Saudi Arabia this month, and want to shift the venue to Qatar, Taliban officials said on Sunday, seeking to fend off Riyadhs push to include the Afghan government in talks. The upcoming negotiations, the fourth in a series aimed at ending the 17-year war in Afghanistan, are scheduled between the leaders of the Taliban and U. S.  special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad to discuss the withdrawal of foreign forces and a possible ceasefire in 2019. Leaders of the hardline Islamic militant group have rejected the Kabul governments offer for direct talks, despite growing international pressure in favor of the Western-backed Afghan government having a seat at the table. We were supposed to meet U. S.  officials in Riyadh next week and continue our peace process that remained incomplete in Abu Dhabi last month,  a senior Taliban member based in Afghanistan told Reuters on condition of anonymity. The problem is that leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) wanted us to definitely meet the Afghan government delegation, which we cannot afford to do now, and we have canceled the meeting in Saudi Arabia,  he said. The Taliban want to change the venue for the talks to Qatar, he said, the political headquarters of the militant group that is fighting to restore strict Islamic law in Afghanistan and the site for earlier talks. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid confirmed the group has decided to cancel the meeting in Saudi Arabia, but did not provide information about a new meeting venue. The United States embassy in Afghanistan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Another senior Taliban leader said the group had explained to Saudi Arabia that it was not possible for the Taliban to meet the Afghan government at this stage. Everyone is aware of the fact that the Afghan government wanted the U. S.  and its allies not to leave Afghanistan and we have paid a heavy price to expel all foreign forces from our country,  he said. Why should we talk to the Afghan government? The Taliban regards the United States as its main adversary in the Afghan war and views direct talks with Washington as a legitimate effort to seek the withdrawal of foreign troops before engaging with the Afghan government. The war in Afghanistan is Americas longest overseas military intervention. It has cost Washington nearly a trillion dollars and killed tens of thousands of people. Diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict have intensified since Taliban representatives began meeting with Khalilzad, an Afghan-born, U. S.  diplomat last year. Officials from the warring sides have met at least three times, but fighting has not subsided.
A Venezuelan Supreme Court judge who once supported President Nicols Maduro has fled to the United States and publicly denounced Maduro's re-election days before the inauguration. Justice Christian Zerpa left Venezuela with his wife and two daughters, according to Miami broadcaster EVTV. Their destination in the U. S.  was unclear. Zerpa met a reporter in Orlando and told the outlet, "I think the president, Nicols Maduro, does not deserve a second chance because the election he supposedly won was not a free election, was not a competitive election. " Maduro won the May 2018 race amid widespread accusations of fraud. He will begin his second term on Thursday. Zerpa said he did not speak out against the election results months ago out of concerns for his family's safety. Maduro's Socialist Party "gradually but steadily" co-opted the Supreme Court and "turned it into an appendage of the executive branch, " according to the International Commission of Jurists. In 2016, following a landslide electoral victory by the opposition, Zerpa helped Maduro consolidate power through a court decision that diminished the powers of Congress, according to Reuters. "They chose me [for the court] because I was one of the loyal, disciplined members in the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, " Zerpa told EVTV. Venezuela's Supreme Court of Justice responded to Zerpa's decision to leave by noting he was being investigated for sexual harassment, lewd acts and psychological violence. Zerpa "fled the country, exercising his constitutional right, to avoid justice and so his crimes remain unpunished, " said Supreme Court President Maikel Moreno. He said the investigation began last November. According to a Reuters investigation, Moreno himself was arrested in connection with the homicide of a teenager in 1989 and was defrocked as an appeals court in 2007 for improperly releasing two murder suspects. "Under Moreno as chief justice, the court proceeded to dismiss every legal challenge to Maduro's authority that has reached the bench, " the report stated. Zerpa is not the first Venezuelan justice to flee to the United States. Former Supreme Court Judge Eladio Aponte Aponte fled in 2012 after accusing the government of corruption. Maduro, then the foreign minister, called him a fugitive who "sold his soul. " Under Maduro, who succeeded President Hugo Chvez in 2013, the once thriving country has seen hyperinflation, shortages of food and medicine, and waves of fleeing citizens rushing the border out of desperation. Caracas has faced angry protests, U. S.  sanctions and a slump in oil exports. The government has also cracked down on dissent through the "arbitrary arrests and detentions" of thousands of people, according to human rights groups. Many detainees say they were tortured and sexually abused. The new president of Venezuela's opposition-controlled National Assembly, Juan Guaido, was sworn in last week. U. S.  State Department spokesperson Robert Palladino called the body "the only legitimate and last remaining democratically elected institution that truly represents the will of the Venezuelan people. "

ADDIS ABABA - The African Union and France warned against any "unconstitutional" change of power in Gabon, whose government on Monday claimed to have foiled an attempted takeover. AU chief Moussa Faki Mahamat, in a tweet, said his organisation "strongly condemns the coup attempt" in Gabon. "I reaffirm the AU's total rejection of all unconstitutional change of power, " said Faki, who is chairman of the AU commission. Separately, France, which ruled Gabon from 1885 until independence in 1960, said it condemned "any extra-constitutional attempt at regime change. " "The stability of Gabon can only be assured by strict adherence to the provisions of the constitution, " foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said in Paris. The ministry also advised French nationals in the capital Libreville -- 8, 900 of whom have registered with the French consulate -- to "avoid moving around" in the capital for time being. Earlier, a group of soldiers took over the headquarters of the state broadcaster at dawn and issued a statement calling on the public to "rise up. " But within hours, the government said the situation was under control and four of the five rebels had been arrested while a fifth was on the run. The upheaval comes as President Ali Bongo is in Morocco after suffering a stroke while abroad. The 59-year-old, scion of a family that has ruled Gabon for more than half a century, has not been in the country since October. In his absence, the Constitutional Court transferred part of the powers of the president to the prime minister and the vice president. The statement read out by the rebels on Monday attacked the arrangement as "illegitimate and illegal. "
A former Uber driver charged with killing six people during an hours-long shooting rampage in Michigan nearly three years ago, pleaded guilty to all charges on Monday, defying his attorney. Jason Dalton was set to stand trial for fatally shooting four women in the parking lot of a Cracker Barrel restaurant, in addition to a father and son who were at a car dealership, and for wounding two additional strangers. But, going against his lawyer's counsel, he surprised the judge and prosecutors by admitting that he was behind the attack, firing at unsuspecting strangers while continuing to pick up Uber fares in between the shootings on Feb.  20, 2016. "I've wanted to do this for quite a while, " Dalton told a judge, putting an end to jury selection, according to the Associated Press. Scott Brower, chief assistant prosecuting attorney in Kalamazoo County, told NPR that Dalton "acknowledged the facts behind each of the charges, " including attempted murder and firearms violations. As a result, the 48-year-old faces a mandatory life sentence without parole for each count of first-degree murder, Brower added. Dalton's motive remains a mystery. Kalamazoo County prosecutor Jeff Getting told the AP "everybody wants to know" what drove Dalton to indiscriminately kill six bystanders who had the misfortune of being in Dalton's line of sight on that terrifying day. Getting added it is a "key question" that investigators have still not answered. "After Dalton's arrest, police quoted him as saying a 'devil figure' on Uber's app was controlling him on the day of the shootings, " the AP said. "The shooting spree started in the early evening outside an apartment complex where a woman was shot five times. That victim was hospitalized. More than four hours passed before the next shooting. A father and son were shot dead at a car dealership. And then about 15 minutes later, four people were killed and one injured sitting in their vehicles in the parking lot of a Cracker Barrel restaurant. All told, six people killed and two were injured. " Days after the shooting, Uber confirmed that Dalton had passed a company background check and that there was no evidence that any warning flags were missed. Police also confirmed Dalton had no criminal record. A passenger named Derek, who rode with Dalton between killings on that day, told NPR he got into the Uber ride and "jokingly" asked, "You aren't the shooter, are you?'" "He either shook his head or said no, and I said, 'Are you sure?' " Derek continued. "And his response wasn't like you would expect, like a laugh. It was just very calm and quiet. It was, 'I'm just tired. No, I'm just tired. ' " Fox 17 reported Dalton's attorney, Eusebio Solis, decided not to pursue an insanity defense late last week. According to the AP, Solis advised Dalton not to plead guilty. But in the end, Dalton determined he "wanted to spare families more grief during a trial. " "We're very happy that we're able to reach this resolution, " Getting said as reported by ABC News. "Doing this is what's best for the people of this community, it's what's best for our victims. "
Michael Kit Carson, a former youth soccer coach, died in a car crash Monday -- the same day he was slated to stand trial on sexual abuse charges. Carson, of the Riverside area of Cambridge, England, was accused of sexually abusing boys under the age of 16 from 1978 to 2009. The 75-year-old man was charged with 12 counts of indecent assault and one of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity,  Sky News reported. In an earlier hearing, he pleaded not guilty to the charges. FRENCH AUTHOR, 50, MOCKED AFTER SAYING HES INCAPABLE OF LOVING WOMEN OVER AGE OF 50 On Monday, Carson was killed after his car hit a tree, police said. He died at the scene and no other vehicle or person was involved. His wife, Pauline, identified his body, the BBC reported. Judge Matthew Lowe of the Peterborough Crown Court ruled the case be closed following Carsons death.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Guatemala announced Monday it was pulling out of a United Nations-sponsored anti-corruption commission after more than a year of tension between the government and the group, which has investigated top government officials and people close to President Jimmy Morales. Foreign Minister Sandra Jovel announced the decision after meeting with Secretary-General Antonio Guterres about the commission, known as CICIG for its initials in Spanish. She accused the group and its members of politicizing its work, violating Guatemala's sovereign authority, failing to respect the presumption of innocence and causing "division in our society. " "The CICIG has exceeded its authority, " she said. Jovel said the commission's staffers have 24 hours to leave the country, though a Guatemalan court has ruled that the country has to grant them visas. There was no immediate response from the U. N.  Before the announcement, spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Guterres continues to support the commission's work "and expects the Guatemalan government to provide the commission with all the assistance necessary for the discharge of its functions and activities. " During its 11 years operating in Guatemala, CICIG has pressed corruption cases that have implicated more than 600 people, including elected officials, businesspeople and bureaucrats. Morales has made no secret of his contempt for the group - formally, the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala - which has investigated the president's son and his brother. They deny accusations of corruption. The commission has also tried to bring a case involving purported illegal campaign financing against Morales, who similarly denies the allegations. Lawmakers so far have rebuffed proposals to lift Morales' immunity from prosecution in the matter. Morales said in August 2017 he was expelling CICIG's chief. Though a court quickly blocked that order, the commission head was later barred from re-entering the country after leaving for a business trip. Last year, Morales refused to renew CICIG's mandate, effectively giving it until September 2019 to wind down operations and leave the country. Most recently, a commission member was detained at an airport for almost a day and refused entry to the country after arriving Saturday. A court ordered his release.
CAIRO (AP)  Sudans government says police have arrested 816 people in nearly three weeks of protests against the 29-year rule of President Omar al-Bashir. Human Rights Watch said on Tuesday that at least 40 people have been killed in the protests, which began Dec.  19, initially over price rises and shortages but soon shifted to calls for al-Bashir to step down. Interior Minister Ahmed Bilal Othman, who gave the figure on the number of people detained, told parliament Monday that 19 people were killed in the protests, including two members of the security forces. Al-Bashir has ordered an investigation into the killings. Authorities also have arrested scores of opposition leaders. Human Rights Watch says security forces have been using live ammunition and excessive force against the protesters as well as arbitrary detentions.
A former vice-mayor of Beijing has been detained as part of an investigation into alleged corruption and amid reports he may have had links to fugitive tycoon Guo Wengui. Chen Gang, who was head of urban development in the Chinese capital for more than a decade, was taken into custody on suspicion of serious violations of party discipline and state law, the National Supervisory Commission said on Sunday, making him the first high-profile official of 2019 to be accused of the standard euphemism for corruption. Ex-spy chief gets life sentence for taking US$15. 8 million in bribes The statement did not elaborate, but Chinese news outlet Caixin reported on Monday that Chen, 52, had used his authority to help Guo, also known as Miles Kwok, to obtain loans and gain government approval for property developments in Beijing. Guo now lives in New York, but is wanted in China in connection with a string of alleged crimes including corruption and rape. Chen was once considered a rising star in Chinese politics and in 2006 was appointed vice-mayor of Beijing with responsibility for urban planning ahead of the 2008 Olympic Games. In 2012 at the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party he was made an alternate member of the Central Committee  the largest of Chinas elite decision-making bodies with more than 370 full and alternate members  only to lose the position at the party congress five years later. No let-up for corrupt tigers in 2018 as Chinas graft-busters claim more big scalps He also lost his post as vice-mayor at the 2017 congress and was reassigned to the South-North Water Diversion Project, before moving on again last year to head the China Association for Science and Technology. According to the Caixin report, Chens links to Guo date back to 2008 when he gave the green light to plans for the development of an office building that was larger than had been approved. The two men had a mutual associate in Ma Jian, then state security minister, who was sentenced to life imprisonment on corruption charges last month. In a videotaped confession Ma said he approached Chen in 2008 to help secure approval for Guos project. Guo, 51, left mainland China in 2013 and is known as a fierce critic of Beijing having made a series of corruption allegations against several senior Chinese officials.

Russian military police have begun patrolling around the Syrian city of Manbij, a spokesman said Tuesday, moving into an area once held by US-backed Kurdish forces. Russian forces are acting in support of Syrian government troops who recently deployed around Manbij, in Aleppo province near the border with Turkey. Kurdish fighters, fearing a Turkish military assault, invited regime forces to Manbij late last month after US President Donald Trump's shock announcement of a full American withdrawal from Syria. Speaking in a report on Rossiya 24 television, Russian military police spokesman Yusup Mamatov said MPs had started patrolling "the security zone around Manbij". "The task is to ensure security in the area of responsibility (and) to monitor the situation and movements of armed formations, " Mamatov said. The report said Russian military police would be deployed in the area "on a regular basis". It showed a group of around a dozen khaki-clad armed military police driving through villages in jeeps and lorries flying the Russian flag. A separate report on Channel One television said military police were patrolling just a few kilometres from Manbij. It said the police would "establish dialogue with local residents" who could report if they found caches of weapons or unexploded munitions. Critics have warned Trump that an abrupt US withdrawal from Syria would allow allies of President Bashar al-Assad's regime -- including Russia and Iran -- to increase their influence in the country. About 2, 000 US troops, mainly special forces, are deployed in Syria to work with local fighters in the battle against the Islamic State group. Kurdish fighters formed the backbone of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which seized Manbij from IS in 2016. They withdrew from the town earlier this month after Trump's announcement. Trump has in recent days sought to calm fears of an abrupt US pullout, saying any withdrawal would be done in a "prudent" manner. It was not clear how close the Russian patrols may have been to areas where US forces are deployed. Syria's Kurdish minority has largely stayed out of the seven-year civil war, but controls large parts of the north and northeast, much of it seized in the US-supported campaign against IS.
The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) captured two Americans in Syria who are suspected of being ISIS fighters, the militia said in a press release Sunday. The militia identified the men as Warren Christopher Clark (Abu Mohammad al-Ameriki) and Zaid Abed al-Hamid (Abu Zaid al-Ameriki). The SDF said Clark is originally from Houston, but it gave no specific location in the United States for the other mans origin. The Americans were captured in a group that also contained fighters from Ireland and Pakistan, SDF said. A Pentagon spokesman said the incident is under investigation. We are aware of open source reports of reportedly American citizens currently in custody who were believed to be fighting for ISIS. However, we are unable to confirm this information at this time,  Commander Sean Robertson said. The White House announced last month that ISIS had been defeated in Syria and the United States would withdraw 2, 000 troops from the war-stricken nation. In October, the US military released another American citizen suspected of being a member of ISIS who was captured in Syria. The dual US-Saudi national was held by the US military in Iraq without being tried since September 2017. His fate was the subject of a months-long legal battle between the US government and the American Civil Liberties Union. When he was released, CNN reported that SDF has more than 700 foreign terrorist fighters in custody from some 40 countries. US officials have encouraged countries to repatriate their citizens in detention in Syria in order to ease the burden on the SDFs detention facilities. But many countries are reluctant to do so because of the difficulty of prosecuting suspected ISIS members based on evidence collected on the battlefield.
Sears gets another reprieve from liquidation NEW YORK (AP)  Sears is getting another reprieve from liquidation after its chairman and largest shareholder revised his bid to save the iconic brand. The Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based retailer says it has accepted Eddie Lampert's bid through an affiliate of his ESL hedge fund that could keep 425 stores open and save tens of thousands of workers, according to a hearing on Tuesday at the bankruptcy court in White Plains, N. Y. The bid now requires Lampert to deposit $120 million by 4 p. m.  Wednesday through his hedge fund. The revised bid is not official, and will be evaluated in an auction set for Jan.  14 that will compete with other bids from liquidators looking to shut it down.
JOHANNESBURG (AP)  Authorities in South Africa say a train collision in the capital has killed three people and injured more than 200. Netcare911, an emergency responders group, says many injuries are minor to moderate but that one person in critical condition was airlifted to a hospital after the accident Tuesday in Pretoria. Authorities are investigating the cause of the collision.
HONG KONG (AP)  An explosion on an oil tanker in Hong Kong on Tuesday killed one crew member and left two others missing at sea, authorities said. The Vietnam-registered tanker burst into flames just before 11:30 a. m.  as it prepared to refuel at an anchorage off the city's southern coast, said Yiu Men-Yeung, commander of the Hong Kong Fire Department marine and diving division. The force of the blast left the 140-meter (460-foot) -long tanker at a 30-degree angle and threw its 25-member crew into the water, Wong Wai-hong, a Hong Kong Police deputy commander, said at a news conference. The refueling barge was destroyed. One crew member was pronounced dead at the scene and seven others were injured. Authorities initially reported at least three crew members missing but later confirmed there were only two. The cargo hold appeared to be the source of the blaze, fire officials said. The vessel, en route to its home port in Thailand, was largely empty.
BEIJING (AP)  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrived in Beijing on Tuesday at the start of a four-day visit, in what's likely an effort to coordinate with his only major ally ahead of a second summit with President Donald Trump that could happen early this year. A long motorcade including motorcycle outriders reserved for state leaders left a Beijing train station shortly after the arrival of an armored train consisting of 20 to 25 cars  most of whose windows were blacked-out  along tracks lined by police and paramilitary troops. Kim's trip, announced earlier by both sides, comes after U. S.  and North Korean officials are believed to have met in Vietnam to discuss the location of a second summit. North's Korean Central News Agency said Kim departed Monday afternoon with his wife, Ri Sol Ju, and other top officials. It said Kim is visiting China at the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping. Tuesday also happens to be Kim's birthday. China's official Xinhua News Agency issued a nearly identical report, while Beijing's North Railway Station was cocooned in security, with dozens of police and paramilitary troops patrolling outside. Kim is expected to stay at the highly secure Diaoyutai State Guest House in the capital's west, with meetings held at the Great Hall of the People, the hulking seat of the legislature that sits next to Tiananmen Square. The trip marked a further break with past practice in that it was announced in advance of Kim's arrival, a possible sign of growing confidence on the part of North Korea and China, Pyongyang's most important trading partner and a key buffer against pressure from Washington. After years of cool relations following Kim's assumption of power 2011, ties have improved remarkably over the past year as Xi seeks to maintain his influence in the region. Kim's trip comes as the U. S.  and North Korea look to settle the North's decades-long pursuit of a nuclear arsenal. Washington and Pyongyang seemed close to war at points during 2017 as the North staged a series of increasingly powerful weapons tests that got it tantalizingly close to its nuclear goal of one day targeting with pinpoint accuracy anywhere on the U. S.  mainland. Possibly fearing the economic effect of crushing outside sanctions imposed because of his weapons' tests, Kim abruptly turned to diplomacy with Seoul and Washington last year. He also visited China three times, notably without a reciprocal visit from Xi in a break with diplomatic convention. But even after what was seen as a blockbuster summit between Kim and Trump in Singapore last June  the first-ever between the leaders of the war enemies  there's been little real progress in nuclear disarmament. Washington is pressing the North to offer up a detailed accounting of its nuclear arsenal, while Pyongyang says it has already done enough and it's time for the U. S.  to ease harsh international sanctions that hold back the North Korean economy. South Korean presidential spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said Tuesday that Seoul hopes Kim's trip to China will act as a "stepping stone" for a second Trump-Kim summit. Trump has offered assurances that another summit will allow him and Kim to make a grand deal to settle the nuclear standoff and change a relationship marked by decades of animosity and mistrust. However, outside analysts are highly skeptical that the North will easily abandon a nuclear arsenal constructed in the face of deep poverty and likely seen by Kim as his only guarantee of regime survival. Instead, Kim may be seeking to gauge China's attitude toward sanctions ahead of the talks, including what the North would have to concede in order to win Beijing's support at the U. N.  The North has held off on additional nuclear weapons and missile tests for more than a year, possibly in response to China's displeasure, while carrying out its new diplomatic offensive. "The two leaders will further communicate over the issue of sanctions to further refine their previously general and vague attitudes, " said Cheng Xiaohe, professor at Renmin University's School of International Studies in Beijing. "It is impossible to see the cancellation of all sanctions, but what kind of sanctions can be cancelled and what are China and North Korea's views on that will be discussed, " Cheng said. Trump has pushed heavily for Chinese support in convincing North Korea to give up its weapons programs, suggesting that could win Beijing better terms in a trade deal with Washington. Kim's arrival in Beijing coincides with U. S. -China trade talks in Beijing that seek to end the trade dispute between the world's two largest economies ahead of a March deadline. Asked whether China was linking to issues in an interview Monday with CNBC, U. S.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, "The Chinese have been very clear to us that these are separate issues. " "Their behavior has demonstrated that as well and we appreciate that, " Pompeo said. "China has actually been a good partner in our efforts to reduce the risk to the world from North Korea's nuclear capability. I expect they will continue to do so. " Associated Press writers Foster Klug and Hyung-jin Kim in Seoul, South Korea, contributed to this report.
