Death toll from Philippine storm, landslides climbs to 126
While the Bicol region is often hit by deadly typhoons, many people failed to take necessary precautions because the storm was not strong enough to be rated as a typhoon under the government's storm alert system, according to civil defence officials."In two days alone, Usman poured more than a month's worth of rainfall in the Bicol region," national disaster agency spokesman Edgar Posadas told AFP, using the local name for the storm which had weakened into a low pressure area.The death toll from a storm that devastated the Philippines shortly after Christmas rose to 126, authorities said Sunday, adding landslides caused by torrential rain were the top cause.More than 152,000 people were displaced by the storm and 75 were injured, according to the national disaster agency.The storm hit central and eastern Philippine islands on December 29 and caused massive flooding and landslides.About 20 typhoons and storms batter the Philippines each year, killing hundreds of people."Our search and retrieval operations are ongoing but the sticky mud and the unstable soil are a challenge."The deadliest in recent years was Super Typhoon Haiyan which left more than 7,360 people dead or missing across the central Philippines in 2013.President Rodrigo Duterte visited the storm-hit areas on Friday and urged officials to build evacuation centres instead of using schools as shelters for the displaced.Officials also said that many residents were reluctant to leave their homes during the Christmas holidays.

Former Venezuela Supreme Court judge flees to , denounces Maduro
CARACAS (Reuters) - Former Venezuelan Supreme Court Justice Christian Zerpa has fled to the United States to protest President Nicolas Maduro’s second term that will begin with his inauguration this week, the onetime Maduro backer told a Miami broadcaster on Sunday.Zerpa was for years a crucial ally of Maduro on the Supreme Court, which has backed the ruling Socialist Party in every major legal dispute since Maduro’s 2013 election.Opposition leaders have urged foreign governments not to recognize Maduro after his inauguration on Thursday, and a group of Latin American nations on Friday called on Maduro not to take office.“I believe (Maduro) does not deserve a second chance because the election he supposedly won was not free and competitive.”

The Supreme Court confirmed in a statement that he had fled, referring to him as a former magistrate and adding it opened an investigation of him in November over accusations of sexual harassment by women in his office.He wrote a 2016 ruling that provided the legal justification for Maduro’s government to strip congress of most of its powers after the Socialist Party lost control of the body to the opposition in a landslide election.The latest defection from the crisis-stricken OPEC nation’s government comes amid growing international pressure on Maduro over his new term, which resulted from a broadly boycotted 2018 vote dismissed by countries around the world as a sham.Zerpa said he did not criticize Maduro’s May 2018 election to make sure he could pave the way for a safe exit from the country in the company of his family.

CubeSats joining Hera mission to asteroid system
Next, the two CubeSats will have their designs refined and interfaces with their mothership finalised, in line with continuing design work on the Hera mission itself, which will be presented to ESA's Space19+ meeting towards the end of this year, where Europe's space ministers will take a final decision on flying the mission.Paolo Martino, Hera spacecraft lead engineer adds: "The idea of building CubeSats for deep space is relatively new, but was recently validated by NASA's InSight landing on Mars last November, when a pair of accompanying CubeSats succeeded in relaying the lander's radio signals back to Earth – as well as returning imagery of the Red Planet."Hera has room to deliver two 'six-unit' CubeSat missions to the Didymos asteroid system – a 780 m-diameter mountain-sized main body is orbited by a 160 m moon, informally called 'Didymoon', about the same size as the Great Pyramid of Giza.Guided by a navigation camera and a 'laser radar' (lidar) instrument, APEX will also make a landing on one of the asteroids, gathering valuable data in the process using inertial sensors, and going on to perform close-up observations of the asteroid's surface material.Hera is set to be humankind's first mission to a binary asteroid system."We're very happy to have these high-quality CubeSat missions join us to perform additional bonus science alongside their Hera mothership," explains Hera manager Ian Carnelli.It will perform detailed spectral measurements of both asteroids' surfaces – measuring the sunlight reflected by Didymos and breaking down its various colours to discover how these asteroids have interacted with the space environment, pinpointing any differences in composition between the two.

Clemson exacts revenge on defending champ Alabama with 44-16 BLOWOUT
In what will certainly go down as the most humiliating performance of his Crimson Tide reign, Saban's team was blown out 44-16 by Clemson in the national championship game Monday night, a result that stamps the Tigers as the country's pre-eminent program and leaves Bama in the rare position of chaser instead of the chasee.And on Monday night at Levi's Stadium, in a championship game played more than 2,000 miles away from Clemson's South Carolina campus, the Tigers were way too much for an Alabama team that had spent the season mauling its opposition by an average of 31 points per game.(Tagovailoa replaced Hurts in last season's title game to guide Alabama to a comeback win over Georgia)

Two seasons ago it was Deshaun Watson dethroning the Tide with a last-second touchdown pass.Head coach Dabo Swinney of the Clemson Tigers meets head coach Nick Saban of the Alabama Crimson Tide at mid-field after his 44-16 win in the national title game Tagovailoa delivered another pick on a deep pass into triple coverage.Sure, there were occasional disappointments along the way — the stunning Kick Six loss to Auburn, a championship game defeat to Clemson two years ago on a touchdown pass with a single second remaining — but Alabama was always in the game.Alabama's star quarterback, Tua Tagovailoa, threw a pair of brutal interceptions and was ultimately pulled in favor of Jalen Hurts in the fourth quarter Saban flashed a bit of his notorious temper early on, barging into the middle of a defensive meeting on the bench to berate a usually fearsome unit that looked helpless against Lawrence & Co.

Problem of captured Islamic State fighters grows as US plans Syria exit

WASHINGTON — Hundreds of foreign Islamic State fighters have been captured in Syria, and what to do with them has become a problem for the Trump administration as it prepares to pull American troops from the country.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday that releasing the fighters would be “unacceptable” because of concerns that they could rejoin Islamic State militants in Syria or elsewhere.“This matters because SDF holds hundreds of Islamic State fighters, including many European citizens, and they might go free if no solution is found,” said Bobby Chesney, a national security law expert at the University of Texas.A Syrian Kurdish militia said Wednesday it had captured eight Islamic State fighters, including a 16-year-old American, a German, and a Russian.European nations have been reluctant to take back citizens with ties to Islamic State, not wanting the legal challenge of prosecuting them or the potential security risk if they are released.Moving former fighters to the United States poses some of the same challenges that Washington has faced with men detained at the military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.Those troops have worked alongside the U.S.-backed Syrian Defense Forces to fight Islamic State since 2015.An administration official said determining the fate of these prisoners, who include Europeans and some U.S. citizens, is a priority as the U.S. lays the groundwork with allies to comply with President Trump’s order to withdraw the 2,000 American troops from Syria.

North Korea's Kim Jong Un arrives in Beijing for talks
Instead, Kim may be seeking to gauge China's attitude toward sanctions ahead of the talks, including what North Korea would have to concede in order to win Beijing's support at the U.N.

China, a veto-wielding permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, has agreed to several rounds of punishing economic sanctions against the North.Washington is pressing North Korea to offer up a detailed accounting of its nuclear arsenal, while the North says it has already done enough and it's time for the U.S. to ease the harsh international sanctions that hold back the North Korean economy.The trip marked a further break with past practice in that it was announced in advance of Kim's arrival, a possible sign of growing confidence on the part of North Korea and China, the North's most important trading partner and a key buffer against pressure from Washington.Kim's trip comes as the U.S. and North Korea look to settle the North's decades-long pursuit of a nuclear arsenal.BEIJING (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrived in Beijing on Tuesday at the start of a four-day visit, in what's likely an effort to coordinate with his only major ally ahead of a second summit with U.S. President Donald Trump that could happen early this year."It is impossible to see the cancellation of all sanctions, but what kind of sanctions can be canceled and what are China and North Korea's views on that will be discussed," Cheng said.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang gave no details about China's role as an intermediary between the U.S. and North Korea, but said Beijing remained supportive of all efforts toward a solution.

The Supreme Court confirmed in a statement that he had fled, referring to him as a former magistrate and adding it opened an investigation of him in November over accusations of sexual harassment by women in his office.He wrote a 2016 ruling that provided the legal justification for Maduro’s government to strip congress of most of its powers after the Socialist Party lost control of the body to the opposition in a landslide election.The latest defection from the crisis-stricken OPEC nation’s government comes amid growing international pressure on Maduro over his new term, which resulted from a broadly boycotted 2018 vote dismissed by countries around the world as a sham.Zerpa said he did not criticize Maduro’s May 2018 election to make sure he could pave the way for a safe exit from the country in the company of his family.

CubeSats joining Hera mission to asteroid system
Next, the two CubeSats will have their designs refined and interfaces with their mothership finalised, in line with continuing design work on the Hera mission itself, which will be presented to ESA's Space19+ meeting towards the end of this year, where Europe's space ministers will take a final decision on flying the mission.Paolo Martino, Hera spacecraft lead engineer adds: "The idea of building CubeSats for deep space is relatively new, but was recently validated by NASA's InSight landing on Mars last November, when a pair of accompanying CubeSats succeeded in relaying the lander's radio signals back to Earth – as well as returning imagery of the Red Planet."Hera has room to deliver two 'six-unit' CubeSat missions to the Didymos asteroid system – a 780 m-diameter mountain-sized main body is orbited by a 160 m moon, informally called 'Didymoon', about the same size as the Great Pyramid of Giza.Guided by a navigation camera and a 'laser radar' (lidar) instrument, APEX will also make a landing on one of the asteroids, gathering valuable data in the process using inertial sensors, and going on to perform close-up observations of the asteroid's surface material.Hera is set to be humankind's first mission to a binary asteroid system."We're very happy to have these high-quality CubeSat missions join us to perform additional bonus science alongside their Hera mothership," explains Hera manager Ian Carnelli.It will perform detailed spectral measurements of both asteroids' surfaces – measuring the sunlight reflected by Didymos and breaking down its various colours to discover how these asteroids have interacted with the space environment, pinpointing any differences in composition between the two.

Clemson exacts revenge on defending champ Alabama with 44-16 BLOWOUT
In what will certainly go down as the most humiliating performance of his Crimson Tide reign, Saban's team was blown out 44-16 by Clemson in the national championship game Monday night, a result that stamps the Tigers as the country's pre-eminent program and leaves Bama in the rare position of chaser instead of the chasee.And on Monday night at Levi's Stadium, in a championship game played more than 2,000 miles away from Clemson's South Carolina campus, the Tigers were way too much for an Alabama team that had spent the season mauling its opposition by an average of 31 points per game.(Tagovailoa replaced Hurts in last season's title game to guide Alabama to a comeback win over Georgia)

Two seasons ago it was Deshaun Watson dethroning the Tide with a last-second touchdown pass.Head coach Dabo Swinney of the Clemson Tigers meets head coach Nick Saban of the Alabama Crimson Tide at mid-field after his 44-16 win in the national title game Tagovailoa delivered another pick on a deep pass into triple coverage.Sure, there were occasional disappointments along the way — the stunning Kick Six loss to Auburn, a championship game defeat to Clemson two years ago on a touchdown pass with a single second remaining — but Alabama was always in the game.Alabama's star quarterback, Tua Tagovailoa, threw a pair of brutal interceptions and was ultimately pulled in favor of Jalen Hurts in the fourth quarter Saban flashed a bit of his notorious temper early on, barging into the middle of a defensive meeting on the bench to berate a usually fearsome unit that looked helpless against Lawrence & Co.

Problem of captured Islamic State fighters grows as US plans Syria exit
Problem of captured Islamic State fighters grows as US plans Syria exit

WASHINGTON — Hundreds of foreign Islamic State fighters have been captured in Syria, and what to do with them has become a problem for the Trump administration as it prepares to pull American troops from the country.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday that releasing the fighters would be “unacceptable” because of concerns that they could rejoin Islamic State militants in Syria or elsewhere.“This matters because SDF holds hundreds of Islamic State fighters, including many European citizens, and they might go free if no solution is found,” said Bobby Chesney, a national security law expert at the University of Texas.A Syrian Kurdish militia said Wednesday it had captured eight Islamic State fighters, including a 16-year-old American, a German, and a Russian.European nations have been reluctant to take back citizens with ties to Islamic State, not wanting the legal challenge of prosecuting them or the potential security risk if they are released.Moving former fighters to the United States poses some of the same challenges that Washington has faced with men detained at the military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.Those troops have worked alongside the U.S.-backed Syrian Defense Forces to fight Islamic State since 2015.An administration official said determining the fate of these prisoners, who include Europeans and some U.S. citizens, is a priority as the U.S. lays the groundwork with allies to comply with President Trump’s order to withdraw the 2,000 American troops from Syria.

North Korea's Kim Jong Un arrives in Beijing for talks
Instead, Kim may be seeking to gauge China's attitude toward sanctions ahead of the talks, including what North Korea would have to concede in order to win Beijing's support at the U.N.

China, a veto-wielding permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, has agreed to several rounds of punishing economic sanctions against the North.Washington is pressing North Korea to offer up a detailed accounting of its nuclear arsenal, while the North says it has already done enough and it's time for the U.S. to ease the harsh international sanctions that hold back the North Korean economy.The trip marked a further break with past practice in that it was announced in advance of Kim's arrival, a possible sign of growing confidence on the part of North Korea and China, the North's most important trading partner and a key buffer against pressure from Washington.Kim's trip comes as the U.S. and North Korea look to settle the North's decades-long pursuit of a nuclear arsenal.BEIJING (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrived in Beijing on Tuesday at the start of a four-day visit, in what's likely an effort to coordinate with his only major ally ahead of a second summit with U.S. President Donald Trump that could happen early this year."It is impossible to see the cancellation of all sanctions, but what kind of sanctions can be canceled and what are China and North Korea's views on that will be discussed," Cheng said.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang gave no details about China's role as an intermediary between the U.S. and North Korea, but said Beijing remained supportive of all efforts toward a solution.
